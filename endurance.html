                        <h3>Why Strength-Endurance Is Important</h3>
                        <p>More often than not, when a trainee begins a strength training routine, he'll usually follow 
                            the tried and true idea of lifting heavy weights for low reps with a good deal of rest time 
                            (both between workouts and during the workout itself). Programs such as these are generally geared 
                            toward the trainee who wants to increase brute (limit) strength. The result of programs such as 
                            these is generally increased 1RMs (one rep maximums) in any given exercise(s). <br>
                            This is all well and good - but there is a slight problem. Most trainees who train for strength aren't 
                            necessarily in need of strength. What they are in need of is strength-endurance. The problem with 
                            programs that focus on increasing your 1 Rep Max is: Should you need to be able to exert that strength 
                            for any time frame beyond what one rep might take, or have to make due with less rest than you're 
                            accustomed, then your strength won't hold up.

                        <h3>So Should We Use High Reps And Low Weight?</h3>
                        <p>Tradition tells us that to train for endurance, we need to use sets of higher reps with lower weight. Wrong! <br>

                            If we are looking for increased strength endurance, then that means essentially that we want to be <br> as strong 
                            as possible for as long as possible. So, instead of giving it your all for one quick burst and <br> then crapping 
                            out, you want to be able to keep exerting yourself for extended periods of time. Now, do you think you can 
                            attain this strength-endurance by pumping out countless reps with a lighter weight? No way - that would be 
                            like telling a man who benches 400-pounds that he'll increase his strength endurance by doing countless pushups.

                        <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
                        <p>OK, now that we know what we want to do, how do we do it? We already have figured out that light sets of many reps 
                            (say 3-4 sets x 12-15 reps) aren't the answer, as we need to lift heavy. However, if we lift heavy, then we can't 
                            use higher reps. So, we use heavy weights for a lot of sets of low reps (say 10-20 sets x 1-4 reps). 
                            Rest periods are then shortened ideally to 20-40 seconds, and are never more than 60 seconds. <br>
                            An increase in endurance? Maybe. An increase in strength-endurance? Nope. <br>
                            A routine such as this allows us to: <br>
                            - Use heavy weights (as we're doing low reps)<br>
                            - Still use large volume (because we're doing more sets)<br>
                            - Shorten rest periods (it doesn't take nearly as long to recover from a couple reps as it does 12-15, so you can do your next set quicker)<br>
                            When you start a routine such as this, either pick a shorter rest time (say 30 seconds) and start with a lighter weight (say 65-70% of 1RM) or a 
                            longer rest time (say 60 seconds) and start with a heavier weight (say 80-85% of 1RM). If you start with the lighter weight, strive to add weight 
                            each workout. If you start with the longer rest time, strive to decrease it each workout. Make your progressions small (only add 5-10 pounds or 
                            decrease rest by 5-10 seconds per workout). Perform any given exercise twice to three times per week.
