                        <h3>What is strength Training?</h3>
                        <p>Strength training involves the performance of physical exercises which are designed to 
                            improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the use of weights but can take a variety of different forms
                            When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health 
                            and well-being, including increased bone, muscle, tendon, and ligament strength and toughness, improved joint function, 
                            reduced potential for injury increased bone density, increased metabolism, increased fitness and improved cardiac function.

                        <h3>What is the technique?</h3>
                        <p>The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions, sets, tempo, exercises and 
                            force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance or size by overloading of a group of muscles. The specific 
                            combinations of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the 
                            exercise: to gain size and strength multiple (4+) sets with fewer reps must be performed using more force. 
                            A wide spectrum of regimens can be adopted to achieve different results, but the classic formula recommended by the 
                            American College of Sports Medicine reads as follows: <br>
                            - 8 to 12 repetitions of a resistance training exercise for each major muscle group at an intensity of 
                            40% to 80% of a one-repetition max (RM) depending on the training level of the participant. <br>
                            - Two to three minutes of rest is recommended between exercise sets to allow for proper recovery. <br>
                            - Two to four sets are recommended for each muscle group. <br>
                            Typically, failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or an inability to meet training goals. 
                            When the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of overload is never reached and the muscle does 
                            not gain in strength. There are cases when cheating is beneficial, as is the case where weaker groups become the weak link in 
                            the chain and the target muscles are never fully exercised as a result.
