                        <h3>What is a cutting diet?</h3>
                        <p>A cutting diet is usually used by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts to cut body fat while maintaining muscle mass.

                            The key distinctions with other weight loss diets are that a cutting diet is catered to each individual, 
                            tends to be higher in protein and carbs, and should be accompanied by weightlifting.
                            
                            Lifting weights regularly is important because it promotes muscle growth, helping combat muscle loss 
                            when you start cutting calories (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).
                            
                            A cutting diet lasts 2–4 months, depending on how lean you are before dieting, and is normally timed 
                            around bodybuilding competitions, athletic events, or occasions like holidays (4Trusted Source).

                        <h3>How to do a cutting diet?</h3>
                        <p>A cutting diet is tailored to each individual and requires you to determine your nutritional needs.
                            Fat loss occurs when you consistently eat fewer calories than you burn.
                            Maintaining adequate protein intake is important on a cutting diet. 
                            Fat plays a key role in hormone production, which makes it crucial for a cutting diet.
                            Carbs play a key role in preserving muscle mass while on a cutting diet.

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>A cutting diet is meant to maximize fat loss while maintaining muscle mass.

                            This diet involves calculating your calorie, protein, fat, and carb needs based on 
                            your weight and lifestyle. You’re only meant to follow it for a few months preceding an 
                            athletic event and should combine it with weightlifting.
                            
                            If you’re interested in this weight loss diet for athletes, consult your trainer or a 
                            medical professional to see if it’s right for you.
