                        <h3>What is a bulking diet?</h3>
                        <p>Bodybuilding is both a recreational and competitive sport that rewards muscle size and definition.

                            The three main phases in bodybuilding are bulking, cutting, and maintenance. Among competitive bodybuilders, 
                            preparation for their contests can be considered a fourth phase.
                            
                            Bulking is the muscle-gaining phase. You’re meant to intentionally consume more calories than your 
                            body needs for a set period — often 4–6 months. These extra calories provide your body with the necessary 
                            fuel to boost muscle size and strength while weight training.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How many calories do I need?</h3>
                        <p>Bulking requires consuming more calories than your body needs.

                            You can estimate your daily calorie needs by using a calorie counter, which considers your weight, sex, age, 
                            height, and physical activity level to estimate your daily calorie needs.
                            
                            Experts recommend consuming 10–20% above your daily weight maintenance calorie needs during the bulking 
                            phase for an average weight gain of 0.25–0.5% of your body weight per week.
                            
                            For example, if you need 3,000 daily calories per day to maintain weight, you should aim to consume 3,300–3,600 
                            instead, depending on your experience level. For a person who weighs 150 pounds (68 kg), this equates to an increase 
                            of 0.4–0.8 pounds (0.2–0.4 kg) per week.
                            While novice bodybuilders who have 6 months or less of weight training experience should aim for the higher end of 
                            this calorie range, bodybuilders with several years of experience should target the lower end to limit increases in body fat. 
                            If you’re gaining less or more than 0.25–0.5% of your body weight per week, you should adjust your calorie intake accordingly.

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>Bulking is a technique used by bodybuilders to increase muscle size and strength.

                            It involves consuming 10–20% more than your daily calorie needs in addition to weight training.
                            
                            To make bulking healthy and effective, you should ensure that your calorie surplus isn’t too high and that you’re 
                            limiting highly processed, nutrient-poor foods. 
                        </p>
