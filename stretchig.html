                        <h3>Do You Need to Stretch at All?</h3>
                        <p>It's a good idea, says the American 
                            College of Sports Medicine. The ACSM recommends 
                            stretching each of the major muscle groups at least two times a week for 60 seconds per exercise.

                            Staying flexible as you age is a good idea. It helps you move better. <br>
                            
                            For example, regular stretching can help 
                            keep your hips and hamstrings flexible later in life, 
                            says Lynn Millar, PhD. She's a physical therapist and professor at Winston-Salem State University. <br>
                            
                            If your posture or activities are a problem, make it a 
                            habit to stretch those muscles regularly. If you have back 
                            pain from sitting at a desk all day, stretches that reverse that posture could help. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Do You Need to Hold a Stretch to Get the Benefit?</h3>
                        <p>Not necessarily. <br> Stretching a muscle to the full extent 
                            of your ability and holding it for 15 to 30 seconds is what's 
                            called a static stretch, and there's no harm in stretching that way as long you don't stretch until it hurts.

                            But studies suggest a dynamic stretch is just as effective, and sometimes better, especially before your workout.
                            
                            A dynamic stretch, like the Standing Cat-Camel, moves a muscle group fluidly through an entire range of motion.

                        <h3>Simple Back Stretch</h3>
                        <p>Exercise physiologist Mike Bracko recommends doing the 
                            "Standing Cat-Camel" as a work-related back stretch. 
                            Here's how: <br> 1) Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees bent slightly. <br> 
                            2) Lean forward, placing your hands just above your knees. <br> 3) Round your back so that your 
                            chest is closed and your shoulders are curved forward. <br> 4) Then arch your back so that 
                            your chest opens and your shoulders roll back. <br> 5) Repeat several times. <br> If your 
                            job keeps you in the same position all day, Bracko suggests doing 2-minute stretch breaks to reverse that posture at least every hour.
