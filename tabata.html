                        <h3>The Tabata Program</h3>
                        <p>Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be one of 
                            the longest four minutes you've ever endured. The structure of the program is as follows: <br>
                            - Work out hard for 20 seconds <br>
                            - Rest for 10 seconds <br>
                            - Complete 8 rounds <br>
                            You push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete 
                            eight sets of each exercise. You can do pretty much any exercise you wish. You can do squats, push-ups, burpees 
                            or any other exercise that works your large muscle groups. Kettlebell exercises work great, too.
